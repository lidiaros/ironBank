Project title: Banking Management System This project aims to create a Banking Management System

Project Description This application allows you to introduce information about users and accounts, in relation to a banking management system. You can add information as well as navigate through users and accounts, setting their basic information, following up their transactions and updating information and/or balances related to the sending/receiving money between account holders or between them and third-party users. Admins play a key role in the management of the application.

As an admin, the banking management system allows you to: -access the balance for any account and modify it -create accounts -delete accounts

As account holder, you are able to: -access your account balance -transfer money to other accounts or third parties -transfer or get money from other accounts or third parties

As a third party user, you can: -transfer money -receive money from account holders

How to use the project Although there is no visible menu, the application still allows you to, depending on the type of user that you are, perform any of the activities explained in the previous point. Although the application was intended to include some security attributes, these are not present in this version of the banking system application, although these will be present in future versions of the app (see point 6).

Credits This Banking Management System was developed by Gonzalo, within the Ironhack's back-end bootcamp program, financed by the SOC (Generalitat de Catalunya). A very special thanks to the professors: Jaume, Alejandro and Jose.

License GPL License allows others to make modification of this code and use it for your own purposes.

Missing parts of assignment Although some kind of security was expected, this version of the app does not include it. Also, future versions will treat interest rates and penalty fees as was asked in the instructions of the assignment. Finally, further testing is expected be implemented in future versions of the app.

These flaws are expected to be improved in future versions of the application. The respond mainly to lack of time (the programmer is currently working full-time besides going through this course).
